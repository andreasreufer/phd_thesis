\chapter{Similar-sized collisions: A parameter study}
\graphicspath{{./03figs/}}

A collision is cratering, when the impactor is much smaller than the target. In this case, the impactor hits the target completely and comes to a full stop, the result is a crater. Such a collision corresponds to a point source energy input into the target and can be treated like an explosion \citep{Melosh:2007p3502}. Scaling laws exist for the resulting crater depth and shape \citep{Holsapple:1993p3018}. 

In cratering collisions the impactor partly misses the target only for very grazing impact angles $\thimp \approx 90 \deg$ and the result deviates from pure cratering and becomes none-trivial. Such a case is shown in figure \label{ch03_fig03} on the right side where $\Rimp \ll \Rtar$. So a cratering collision results either in a complete hit or a complete miss. If on the other hand the target and the impactor are similar in size, this critical angle becomes much smaller than $90 \deg$ and the collision is called similar-sized, this is depicted on the left side of the figure in which case $\theta_{graz} \approx 45^\circ$. This grazing angle where roughly half of the impactor misses the target yields
\begin{equation}
\label{ch03_eq001}
\cos{ \theta_{graz} }= \frac{\Rtar}{\Rtar + \Rimp}
\end{equation}

The grazing impact angle $\theta_{graz}$ is defined as the angle for which half of the impactor simply grazes past the target \citep{Asphaug:2010p3539}. The dashed circles show the largest impact angle for which no impactor material would graze past the target $\theta_A$ and the $90^\circ$ impact angle for which the whole impactor grazes past the target.}

Compare figure \ref{ch07_fig01} for an illustration of those volumes. Note that the ratio of radii scales with the cubic root of the mass ratio: $R_{imp} / R_{tar} \sim \sqrt[3]{\gamma}$. The dotted line shows for which impact angle half of the impactor volume grazes past the target. }

Assuming the impactor follows a straight trajectory, the volume missing the target can be calculated by integrating the cross section along the target volume (Compare appendix \ref{ch07_sec01} for the derivation). Figure \ref{ch03_fig05} on the left side shows the relative volume of the impactor missing the target ($V_{hit, imp}$) as a function of impact angle for different mass ratios $\gamma$ assuming constant and equal density spheres as bodies. The volume follows a step-function for very small impactors (small $\gamma$) with a sharp drop-off to zero near $90 \deg$. For similar-sized collisions with $\gamma = 0.1 \dots 1.0$ the relative volume smoothly increases for smaller impact angles opens the possibility for a variety of collisional outcomes between a total hit and a total miss. For example even for a rather small $\gamma = 0.1$, the relative volume hit by the impactor varies between 0 and 1 over an impact angle range of $30 \deg$.

Similar sized collisions are interesting, because bodies in planetary systems grow mainly by big accretionary events. Or in other words, the evolution of the largest bodies is dominated by similar-sized collisions. Many phenomena in planetary systems can best be explained as direct results of similar-sized collisions. Examples are the formation of the Earths Moon \citep{Benz:1985p1755}, Plutos companion Charon \cite{Canup:2005p1987} or also the anomalously high density of Mercury \cite{Benz:1988p3336}. Understanding similar-sized collisions is therefore key for understanding planet formation in general.

Compared to cratering collisions the interplay of the governing physics is more complex and there are only very basic scaling laws predicting the outcomes of similar-sized collisions. Hydrodynamics, gravity and thermodynamics interact in a interacted way and need to be simulated explicitly. The goal of this chapter is to perform a small parameter study in the regime of similar-sized collisions by performing a large number of impact simulations and then looking at various characteristic parameters describing the outcome of the collisions. The first section gives a quick overview of the physical processes involved in similar sized collisions and their associated timescales. In a second section, the detailed setup of the simulations and the used parameters are described. The actual results are presented in the third and discussed in the fourth section.

\section{Physics of similar-sized collisions}
Looking at the associated timescales of physics gives a feeling on what are the important aspect of physics in similar-sized collisions. In the gravity regime, where the impact velocities are in the order of the mutual escape velocity, similar-sized collisions possess the nice property scale-invariance on the first order: When the impact velocity is scaled to the escape velocity $\vesc$ and time to the collisional time $\tcol = ( \Rimp + \Rtar ) / \vesc$ the collision becomes self-similar. In other words: A collision at a given impact velocity and angle for a certain mass ration $\gamma = \Mimp / \Mtar$ has the same outcome for a target mass of $0.01 \ME$ and $1.0 \ME$ assuming the bodies have in both cases the same density and effects like shocks or compressibility can be neglected.

The collisional timescale is an estimate on how long it takes for the impactor to penetrate into the target and is given by
\begin{align}
\tau_{coll} = \frac{2 (\Rimp + \Rtar)}{\vimp} \sim \frac{\vesc}{\vimp} \frac{2 R_{tot}}{\vesc} \sim \frac{\vesc}{\vimp}  \frac{2 R_{tot}}{\sqrt{G \rho} R_{tot}} \sim \frac{\vesc}{\vimp} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}
\end{align}
where the mutual escape velocity is given by $\vesc = \sqrt{ 2 G \frac{\Mtar + \Mimp}{\Rtar + \Rimp} }$ and constant density bodies are assumed. Gravitational restitution happens on the gravitational timescale given by
\begin{align}
\tau_{grav} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi }{G \rho} } \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\rho}}
\end{align}
and is in the same order of magnitude as the collisional timescale. Both timescales depend on the bodies density. The collisional timescale also weakly depends on the mass ratio ($\sim \sqrt[3]{\gamma}$), but stays still in the same order of magnitude for the similar sized collisions mass ratios of $\gamma = 0.1 \dots 1$. For a collisions between with $\Mimp = \Mtar = 0.1\ME$ and $\Rimp = \Rtar = 0.55 \RE$ at their mutual escape velocity, the collisional timescale yields $50$ min, whilst the gravitational timescale for a mean-density of $4g/cm^3$ is around $100$ mins. 

Other physical effects are not scale-invariant, for example viscosity. \cite{Asphaug:2010p3539} argues as follows, that viscosity can be neglected in similar-sized collisions for bodies of at least a certain size: Characteristic stresses due to gravity are 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{grav} \sim P_0 \sim G \rho^2 R^2
\end{equation}
where $P_0$ is the pressure inside the body with radius $R$. The strain rate $\dot{\epsilon}$ for a given Newtonian viscosity $\nu$ is then
\begin{equation}
\dot{\epsilon} = \frac{\sigma}{\nu}
\end{equation}
The strain which can develop over a gravitational timescale under viscosity is then
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{\dot{\epsilon}}{\tau_{grav}}
\end{equation}
Viscosity becomes an important effect, if the maximal strain which can develop over a gravitational timescale is only around unity. Or in other words, when the timescale for a strain of around unity becomes the same order of magnitude as the gravitational timescale, then viscosity is an important effect. Viscosity in the mantle of the early Earth was around $\nu \approx 10^9~\textrm{poise}$ \citep{2004Tectp.384...55W}, whereas for completely molten rock even lower values of around $\nu \approx 10^8~\textrm{poise}$ expected. \cite{Asphaug:2010p3539} gives a lower limit of a few $100km$ for solid and around $10km$ for partially molten bodies for which viscosity can be neglected and using a inviscid hydrodynamics solver is valid. Large bodies can be assumed to be molten during the early stages of planet formation 

Shocks are another effects where similar-sized collisions deviate from scale-invariance: The escape velocity scales $\vesc \sim M^\frac{1}{3}$ for constant density bodies \footnote{$\vesc = \sqrt[6]{8 \pi G^3 \rho} M^\frac{1}{3} \sim M^\frac{1}{3}$} and is around $1km/s$ for a density of $4g/cm^3$ and a mass of $10^{-3} \ME$. This is below the speed of sound in silicates ($\approx 3 km/s$, \cite{Melosh:2007p3502}), so that a collision with an impact velocity on the order of the escape velocity will produce acoustic waves but no strong shocks. For bodies with masses higher than a few Moon masses, the impact velocity comes into the same range as the speed of sound. Collisions now are in the hypervelocity regime and produce strong shock, leading to a considerable heating. 

The goal of this parameter study is now to get quantitative results for various quantities and to check whether they are scale-invariant or not.


\section{Setup and parameters used}
A similar-sized collisions encompasses many parameters, the most important ones being target mass $\Mtar$, impactor mass $\Mimp$, impact velocity $\vimp$ and impact angle $\thimp$. Often the scaled impact parameter $b'=\sin{\thimp}$ is used instead of the impact angle. These parameters span a 4-dimensional parameter space which will be explored in this parameter study. 

Additional parameters are the pre-impact rotation of both the impactor and the target, which in principle spans another 6-dimensions into the parameter space. Another parameter study concerning the formation of the Earths Moon by \cite{Canup:2008p3551} analyzed the effect of pre-impact rotation of the two bodies onto disk formation after the collision and found it to be non-negligible. The composition and interior thermal profiles of both bodies are also inform parameters. They both determine the density distribution inside the bodies and therefore also the dynamics of the collision. The internal profile furthermore determines the radius of the body and therefore the impact geometry, the mutual escape velocity and accordingly the actual impact velocity. These additional parameters are not further explored in this study.

Grey points denote \emph{r3} bodies (pure silicate), red points \emph{c1} bodies (chondritic, differentiated) and blue points \emph{i1} bodies (icy, differentiated). For each mass pair a total of 105 simulations sample the $\big\{ \thimp, \vimp / \vesc \big\}$ sub-space. Points in this sub-space are chosen so that regions of interest are sampled more accurately, for example in case of slow impact velocities ($\vimp < 1.5 \vesc$) and grazing impact angles ($\thimp > 45 \deg$).}

\caption{Isentropic internal structures of the bodies used in the simulations. The first row of plots shows the density profiles, the second row the pressure and the third row the temperatures. The first column of plots shows silicate bodies with a $100 wt\%$ $\silc$ composition with the following masses from left to right: 0.1 (blue curve), 0.2 (red), 0.5 $\ME$ (magenta). The second column shows structures of differentiated bodies of chondritic composition with a $70 wt\%$ $\silc$ mantle and a $30 wt\%$ iron core: 0.002 (red), 0.007 (green), 0.01 (blue), 0.02 (red), 0.035 (black), 0.07 (green), 0.1 (blue), 0.2 (red), 0.7 (green) and 1.0 $\ME$ (blue). The last column on the right shows a few structures with a composition typical to regions beyond the snow line with $50 wt\%$ water ice, $35 wt\%$ $\silc$ and $15 wt\%$ iron. Masses range from 0.002 (red), 0.01 (blue), 0.02 (red), 0.1 (blue), 0.2 (red) and 1.0 $\ME$ (blue) from left to right. The radius of the structures depends on the average density and therefore also on the composition of the bodies. Icy bodies have low average densities compared to chondritic bodies. Note that the bodies entirely composed of $\silc$ have a higher average density than equally massive bodies with a chondritic composition, due to the higher compressibility of $\silc$ compared to iron. In the core of the pure silicate bodies, the density reached more than twice the reference density of $\silc$, while the iron cores of the chondritic bodies is only slightly compressed.}
\label{ch03_fig07}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The strategy for sampling the parameter space goes as follows: For three different types of body composition sets of simulations are performed. Simulation set \emph{r3} uses homogeneous bodies made up of $100 \wtp~\silc$, simulation set \emph{c1} differentiated bodies with a chondritic composition of $70 \wtp~\silc$ and $30 \wtp~\iron$ and simulation set \emph{i1} uses differentiated bodies with a composition typical beyond the snow line of of $50 \wtp~\watr$, $35 \wtp~\silc$ and $15 \wtp~\iron$. Figure \ref{ch03_fig07} shows the internal structures for this three different types of bodies.

The general idea now is to use the \rss simulation with its simple internal structures to get a feeling for the different collisional effects and the scaling. The more realistic \css and \iss are then used to model actual collisions in planetary systems. Figure \ref{ch03_fig01} shows the sampling of the 4-dimensional parameter space mentioned above for the three different simulation sets.  The \rss simulation set uses three different mass ratios $\gamma = \Mimp / \Mtar$ with an impactor mass of $0.1 \ME$. The simulation sets \css and \iss cover three magnitudes of target masses in the range important for late terrestrial planet formation ($0.01 \dots 1 \ME$). The \css simulation set covers each target mass with at least impactors with a mass ratio of $\gamma = 0.2$ and  $0.7$. For the $0.1 \ME$ target, additional impactos with a mass ratio of $\gamma = 0.35$ and $0.1$ are also used. The \iss simulation set only uses impactors with a mass ratio of $\gamma = 0.2$.

\caption{An order of magnitude estimation of the random velocities for bodies undergoing collisions in a protoplanetary system with a solar mass central star. The random velocity is roughly the Kepler velocity times the orbital eccentricity. Shown are isolines of velocities for given distance from a star with a solar mass for given eccentricities. The red line shows the speed of sound of for quartz at standard conditions \cite{Melosh:2007p3502}. Note that the actual impact velocity is given by $\vimp = \sqrt{ v_{rand}^2 + \vesc^2}$ and depends on the masses of the two colliding bodies. Due to the high Kepler velocity in the inner parts of the system, even small eccentricities lead to random velocities well above the speed of sound for silicates and therefore to hypervelocity impacts even for small bodies.}
