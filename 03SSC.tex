\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{07_strucs.pdf}
\caption{Isentropic internal structures of the bodies used in the simulations. The first row of plots shows the density profiles, the second row the pressure and the third row the temperatures. The first column of plots shows silicate bodies with a $100 wt\%$ $\silc$ composition with the following masses from left to right: 0.1 (blue curve), 0.2 (red), 0.5 $\ME$ (magenta). The second column shows structures of differentiated bodies of chondritic composition with a $70 wt\%$ $\silc$ mantle and a $30 wt\%$ iron core: 0.002 (red), 0.007 (green), 0.01 (blue), 0.02 (red), 0.035 (black), 0.07 (green), 0.01 (blue), 0.2 (red), 0.7 (green) and 1.0 $\ME$ (blue). The last column on the right shows a few structures with a composition typical to regions beyond the snow line with $50 wt\%$ water ice, $35 wt\%$ $\silc$ and $15 wt\%$ iron. Masses range from 0.002 (red), 0.01 (blue), 0.02 (red), 0.1 (blue), 0.2 (red) and 1.0 $\ME$ (blue) from left to right. The radius of the structures depends on the average density and therefore also on the composition of the bodies. Icy bodies have low average densities compared to chondritic bodies. Note that the bodies entirely composed of $\silc$ have a higher average density than equally massive bodies with a chondritic composition, due to the higher compressibility of $\silc$ compared to iron. In the core of the pure silicate bodies, the density reached more than twice the reference density of $\silc$, while the iron cores of the chondritic bodies is only slightly compressed.}

\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{06_vimp}
\caption{An order of magnitude estimation of the random velocities for bodies undergoing collisions in a protoplanetary system with a solar mass central star. The random velocity is roughly the Kepler velocity times the orbital eccentricity. Shown are isolines of velocities for given distance from a star with a solar mass for given eccentricities. The red line shows the speed of sound of for quartz at standard conditions \cite{Melosh:2007p3502}. Note that the actual impact velocity is given by $\vimp = \sqrt{ v_{rand}^2 + \vesc^2}$ and depends on the masses of the two colliding bodies. Due to the high Kepler velocity in the inner parts of the system, even small eccentricities lead to random velocities well above the speed of sound for silicates and therefore to hypervelocity impacts even for small bodies.}
