"Collisions and impacts in planetary systems"

1. introduction
- short overview of planet formation
- importance of SSC

2. code description
- N-Body problem
- B&H tree, walks, algorithm
- SPHLATCH v1, how to parallelize for distributed memory
- SPHLATCH v2, how to parallelize for shared memory, cache strategies
- cost strategy
- ANEOS: tables, issues
- clump detection, FOF vs. gravitationally bound
- flavouring of bodies, atmospheres
- dynamics, 2body mechanics
- 1D Lagrange code for structure calculations

3. SSC
- categories
