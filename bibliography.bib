	Abstract = {Prior models of lunar-forming impacts assume that both the impactor and the target protoearth were not rotating prior to the Moon-forming event. However, planet formation models suggest that such objects would have been rotating rapidly during the late stages of terrestrial accretion. In this paper I explore the effects of pre-impact rotation on impact outcomes through more than 100 hydrodynamical simulations that consider a range of impactor masses, impact angles and impact speeds. Pre-impact rotation, particularly in the target protoearth, can substantially alter collisional outcomes and leads to a more diverse set of final planet disk systems than seen previously. However, the subset of these impacts that are also lunar-forming candidates---i.e. that produce a sufficiently massive and iron-depleted protolunar disk---have properties similar to those determined for collisions of non-rotating objects [Canup, R.M., Asphaug, E., 2001. Nature 412, 708 712; Canup, R.M., 2004a. Icarus 168, 433 456]. With or without pre-impact rotation, a lunar-forming impact requires an impact angle near 45 degrees, together with a low impact velocity that is not more than 10% larger than the Earth's escape velocity, and produces a disk containing up to about two lunar masses that is composed predominantly of material originating from the impactor. The most significant differences in the successful cases involving pre-impact spin occur for impacts into a retrograde rotating protoearth, which allow for larger impactors (containing up to 20% of Earth's mass) and provide an improved match with the current Earth Moon system angular momentum compared to prior results. The most difficult state to reconcile with the Moon is that of a rapidly spinning, low-obliquity protoearth before the giant impact, as these cases produce disks that are not massive enough to yield the Moon.},

@article{Thompson:1988p3451,
	Abstract = {Two-phase disks may be gravitationally unstable at temperatures or surface densities at which a disk composed of either single phase would be highly stable. It is argued that two-phase disks can achieve a marginally unstable state (in addition to a highly unstable state that leads to fragmentation), limited by the ability of the photosphere to radiate the energy dissipated in the disk. A self-consistent prescription for the viscosity induced by the slow instabilities is provided. Two-phase disks are more centrally condensed than single-phase disks, and their secular cooling time may be comparable to their spreading time. A circumterrestrial disk of sufficient mass to form the moon provides a detailed example of all the preceding points. Its stability, structure, and dynamical evolution are investigated, and it is concluded that its spreading time is short (about 100 yr); the moon is formed molten, or partially molten; the moon's initial orbit lies in the earth's equatorial plane; and only a small fraction of the disk mass is lost in a wind, although this may represent a substantial fraction of volatiles. Most of these conclusions are independent of how the disk was formed, e.g., from a giant impact.},

	Abstract = {Pluto and its moon, Charon, are the most prominent members of the Kuiper belt, and their existence holds clues to outer solar system formation processes. Here, hydrodynamic simulations are used to demonstrate that the formation of Pluto-Charon by means of a large collision is quite plausible. I show that such an impact probably produced an intact Charon, although it is possible that a disk of material orbited Pluto from which Charon later accumulated. These findings suggest that collisions between 1000-kilometer-class objects occurred in the early inner Kuiper belt.},

	Abstract = {Models of planetary formation are developed using the present single example of a planetary system, supplemented by limited astrophysical observations of star-forming regions and circumstellar disks. The solar nebula theory and the planetesimal hypothesis are discussed. The latter is found to provide a viable theory of the growth of the terrestrial planets, the cores of the giant planets, and the smaller bodies present in the solar system. The formation of solid bodies of planetary size should be a common event, at least around young stars which do not have binary companions orbiting at planetary distances. Stochastic impacts of large bodies provide sufficient angular momentum to produce the obliquities of the planets. The masses and bulk compositions of the planets can be understood in a gross sense as resulting from planetary growth within a disk whose temperature and surface density decreased with distance from the growing sun.},

@article{Stewart:2009p3265,
	Abstract = {The resistance of planetesimals to collisional erosion changes dramatically during planet formation. The transition between accretion and erosion from a collision is defined by the relationship between the mass of the largest remnant (M lr) and the normalized specific impact energy (Q/Q* D ), where Q* D are the size-dependent catastrophic disruption criteria (the Q required to disperse half the target mass). Here, we calculate Q* D for gravitationally bound aggregates subject to low-velocity collisions (1-300 m s-1) and compare the results to previous work at high velocities. We find that Q* D varies by orders of magnitude depending on the impact velocity and material properties. We define new variables to describe catastrophic disruption that remove ambiguities (over material density and projectile-to-target mass ratio) that are inherent in the traditional variables (Q and target radius): R C1 is the spherical radius of the combined projectile and target masses (M tot) at a density of 1 g cm-3, QR is 0.5{\^I}¼V 2 i/M tot ({\^I}¼ is the reduced mass and V i is the impact velocity), and Q* RD is the QR required to disperse half the combined mass. We derive a universal law for the largest remnant, M lr/M tot = -0.5(QR /Q* RD - 1) + 0.5, and velocity-dependent catastrophic disruption criteria for strong and weak planetesimals for use in numerical studies of planet formation. Weak aggregate bodies are easily disrupted due to efficient momentum coupling during low-velocity collisions. Collisional growth of planetesimals requires a dynamically cold environment; alternatively, a noncollisional mechanism is required to form planetesimals large enough to be resistant to collisional disruption (several tens of kilometers).},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial planet formation is believed to have concluded in our Solar System with about 10million to 100million years of giant impacts, where hundreds of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos acquired random velocities through gravitational encounters and resonances with one another and with Jupiter. This led to planet-crossing orbits and collisions that produced the four terrestrial planets, the Moon and asteroids. But here we show that colliding planets do not simply merge, as is commonly assumed. In many cases, the smaller planet escapes from the collision highly deformed, spun up, depressurized from equilibrium, stripped of its outer layers, and sometimes pulled apart into a chain of diverse objects. Remnants of these `hit-and-run' collisions are predicted to be common among remnant planet-forming populations, and thus to be relevant to asteroid formation and meteorite petrogenesis.},

	Abstract = {Current models for the formation of the terrestrial planets suggest that the final stage of planetary accretion is characterized by collisions between tens to hundreds of lunar to Mars-sized planetary embryos. In this view, large impacts are an inevitable outcome as a system of embryos destabilizes to yield the final few planets. One such impact is believed to be responsible for the origin of the Moon. Improvements in numerical methods have recently allowed for the first direct orbit integrations of the final stage of accretion, which is believed to persist for ~108 yr. The planetary systems produced by these simulations bear a general resemblence to the terrestrial planets, but on average differ from our system in the final number of planets (fewer), their orbital spacings (wider) and their eccentricities and inclinations (larger). The discrepancy between these predictions and the nearly circular orbits of both Earth and Venus is significant, and is likely a result of the approximations inherent to the late-stage accretion simulations performed to date. Results from these works further highlight the important role of stochastic impact events in determining final planetary characteristics. In particular, impacts capable of supplying the angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system are predicted to be common.},

	Abstract = {We present a series of two-dimensional (r,{\"I}) hydrodynamic simulations of marginally self-gravitating disks (MD/M*=0.2, with M*=0.5 Msolar and with disk radius RD=50 and 100 AU) around protostars using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code. We implement simple and approximate prescriptions for heating via dynamical processes in the disk. Cooling is implemented with a simple radiative cooling prescription, which does not assume that local heat dissipation exactly balances local heat generation. Instead, we compute the local vertical (z) temperature and density structure of the disk and obtain a ``photosphere temperature,'' which is then used to cool that location as a blackbody. We synthesize spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for our simulations and compare them to fiducial SEDs derived from observed systems, in order to understand the contribution of dynamical evolution to the observable character of a system. We find that these simulations produce less distinct spiral structure than isothermally evolved systems, especially in approximately the inner radial third of the disk. Pattern amplitudes are similar to isothermally evolved systems farther from the star, but patterns do not collapse into condensed objects. We attribute the differences in morphology to increased efficiency for converting kinetic energy into thermal energy in our current simulations. Our simulations produce temperatures in the outer part of the disk that are very low (~10 K). The radial temperature distribution of the disk photosphere is well fitted to a power law with index q~1.1. Far from the star, corresponding to colder parts of the disk and long-wavelength radiation, known internal heating processes (PdV work and shocks) are not responsible for generating a large fraction of the thermal energy contained in the disk matter. Therefore gravitational torques responsible for such shocks cannot transport mass and angular momentum efficiently in the outer disk. Within ~5-10 AU of the star, rapid breakup and reformation of spiral structure causes shocks, which provide sufficient dissipation to power a larger fraction of the near-infrared radiated energy output. In this region, the spatial and size distributions of grains can have marked consequences on the observed near-infrared SED of a given disk and can lead to increased emission and variability on <~10 yr timescales. The inner disk heats to the destruction temperature of dust grains. Further temperature increases are prevented by efficient cooling when the hot disk midplane is exposed. When grains are vaporized in the midplane of a hot region of the disk, we show that they do not reform into a size distribution similar to that on which most opacity calculations are based. With rapid grain reformation into the original size distribution, the disk does not emit near-infrared photons. With a plausible modification of the opacity, it contributes much more.},

	Abstract = {A novel tree-based, high-order integration scheme for the numerical simulation of collisional N-body systems is presented. In the present implementation the tree is allowed to deform with time, and the properties of each component cell are not calculated afresh at each step but instead are predicted only as needed. Cells are represented by a multipole expansion that can extend as far as the octupole term, depending on the relative costs of the multipole and individual-particle calculations. A block time step algorithm is used to simplify scheduling and to allow full vectorization of the code. The integrator conserves energy to a few parts per million per crossing time, and its measured O(N exp 1.5) scaling suggests that it will become competitive with NBODY5, the 'standard' high-precision integrator for small systems, for N greater than about 10,000. It is concluded that tree-based schemes can be confidently applied to collisional problems without excessive concern that the tree algorithm will seriously disturb the relaxation processes that drive the evolution.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of a circumterrestrial disk of debris generated by a giant impact on Earth and the dynamical characteristics of the moon accreted from the disk by using high-resolution N-body simulation. We find that in most cases the disk evolution results in the formation of a single large moon on a nearly circular orbit close to the equatorial plane of the initial disk just outside the Roche limit, which is consistent with the previous work by S. Ida et al. (1997, Nature 389, 353-357). The efficiency of incorporation of disk material into a moon is 10-55%, which increases with the initial specific angular momentum of the disk. These results hardly depend on the initial condition of the disk as long as the mass of the disk is 2 to 4 times the present lunar mass and most mass of the disk exists inside the Roche limit. The timescale of the disk evolution is determined mainly by the surface density of the disk because mass transfer to the outside of the Roche limit and formation of lunar seeds are regulated by collective behavior of disk particles. The evolution of the disk is summarized as follows: The disk contracts through collisional damping. As the velocity dispersion of disk particles decreases, particle clumps grow inside the Roche limit. The clumps become elongated due to Keplerian shear, which forms spiral arm-like structure. Particles are transfered to the outside of the Roche limit through the gravitational torque exerted by the spiral arms. When a tip of a spiral arm goes beyond the Roche limit, it collapses into a small moonlet. The rapid accretion of these small moonlets forms a lunar seed. The seed exclusively grows by sweeping up particles transfered over the Roche limit. When the moon becomes large enough to gravitationally dominate the disk, it pushes the rest of the inner disk to Earth. The formation timescale of the moon is of the order of 1 month if a particulate disk is assumed and the effect of melting/vaporization is not included.},

@article{Agertz:2006p1552,
	Abstract = { We have carried out a hydrodynamical code comparison study of interacting multiphase fluids. The two commonly used techniques of grid and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) show striking differences in their ability to model processes that are fundamentally important across many areas of astrophysics. Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz or Rayleigh-Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH, at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients. This results in a boundary gap of the size of the SPH smoothing kernel over which information is not transferred. },

@article{Melosh:2007p3502,
	Abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of SiO2 are approximated over a range of pressures and temperatures important under the extreme conditions achieved in impacts at typical solar system velocities from 5 to about 70 km/s. The liquid/vapor phase curve and critical point of SiO2 are computed using the equation of state (EOS) program ANEOS. To achieve this goal, two shortcomings of ANEOS are corrected. ANEOS, originally developed at Sandia National Laboratories to describe metals, treats the vapor phase as a monatomic mixture of atoms, rather than molecular clusters. It also assumes a Morse potential for the expanded solid state. Neither of these assumptions is accurate for geologic materials, such as SiO2, that contain molecular clusters in the vapor phase and are better described by a Mie-type potential in the solid state. Using the updates described here, an EOS adequate for numerical hydrocode computations is constructed that agrees well with shock data at pressures up to at least 600 GPa and temperatures up to 50,000 K. This EOS also gives a good representation of the liquid/vapor transition at much lower pressures and temperatures. The estimated critical point parameters for SiO2 are Pc = 0.19 GPa, Tc = 5400K, {\"I}c = 550 kg/m3.},
